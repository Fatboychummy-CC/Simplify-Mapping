# Simplify-Mapping
Simplifies mapping your world with Advanced Peripherals' Geoscanner, or 
Plethora's Block Scanner. This library is designed to be easy to use, and
easy to understand. It can be used for a variety of purposes, such as
pathfinding or simply mapping out your world.

## Features
- Utilizes the Geoscanner from Advanced Peripherals, or the Block Scanner from
  Plethora to create 3D maps of the surrounding environment.
- Provides a simple API for interacting with the Geoscanner or Block Scanner.
- Generates maps distinguishing between empty blocks and solid blocks.
- Designed for easy integration into pathfinding algorithms, or other
  applications.
- A custom binary file format for saving and loading maps, to reduce file size
  and improve performance.
  - I am always looking for improvements to this! If you have any ideas, feel
    free to submit a pull request.
