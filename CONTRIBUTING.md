# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! I appreciate your time
and effort in helping this library improve.

## Getting Started

To get started with contributing, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Make your changes and **test them thoroughly.** Your changes should not break
  existing functionality, and will not be accepted without tests.
4. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message.
5. Push your changes to your forked repository.
6. Open a pull request to the main repository.

The testing framework used is
[CCTest-Framework](https://github.com/Fatboychummy-CC/CCTest-Framework). The
installer will not install the framework, so you will need to install it
manually to the `tests` folder (just the `Framework` folder is required).


## Guidelines

Please keep the following guidelines in mind while contributing:

- Follow the coding style and conventions used in the project.
- Write clear and concise commit messages.
- **Test your changes thoroughly before submitting a pull request.** Again, your
  changes should not break existing functionality, and will not be accepted
  without tests.
- Be respectful and considerate towards other contributors.

## Code of Conduct

I do not ask a lot of the way you conduct yourself towards myself, but please be
respectful and considerate towards other contributors. If you have any issues
with another contributor, please reach out to me directly.

## Feedback and Support

If you have any questions, feedback, or need support, please reach out to me
through the issue tracker or via the MCCM Discord.
